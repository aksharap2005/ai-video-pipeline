Imagine a region in space so dense and heavy that not even light can escape its gravitational pull - that's a black hole. Located at the center of many galaxies, black holes are formed when massive stars collapse under their own weight. 

This massive star is about 20 times bigger than our sun, and when it runs out of fuel, it collapses in upon itself, causing a massive amount of matter to be squeezed into an incredibly small space. That's what creates an incredibly strong gravitational pull, so strong that it warps the fabric of space and time around it.

Imagine space and time like a trampoline, where massive objects create dips and curves. On a black hole, the curve is so sharp that it essentially creates a point of no return, where anything that crosses it gets pulled into the black hole's center. 

Once matter crosses this point, known as the event horizon, it's trapped forever. As it approaches the center, known as the singularity, the gravity gets stronger and stronger, until finally, it's consumed by an intense gravitational storm that's known as a black hole.

Despite being invisible, black holes have a profound impact on the surrounding space. They can even bend the light around them, creating a spectacular display that's known as gravitational lensing. So, the next time you hear about black holes, remember, they're not just regions in space, but powerful objects that shape the universe around them.
